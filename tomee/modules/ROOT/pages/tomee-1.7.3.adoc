###Java EE7 and Beyond

From this point on the TomEE community will be focusing most of it's efforts on TomEE 7.0.0, which will be the first TomEE Java EE 7 driven version running on Apache Tomcat 8.x.
It is more than likely that support for Java SE 6 will be dropped so that Java SE 7 features can finally be leveraged during the development process.
We will of course continue to maintain the 1.7.x branch for the foreseeable future.
