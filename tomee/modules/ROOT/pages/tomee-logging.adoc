Logging in TomEE is configured using the conf/logging.properties file.
Here are some of the benefits:

You do not have to author a logging.properties from scratch.

You get one with sensible defaults.

If you did modify the default file, and you wanted to revert back to the default file generated by TomEE, all you have to do is

Delete or rename the file e.g. rename it to logging.properties.BAK .

Restart the server
