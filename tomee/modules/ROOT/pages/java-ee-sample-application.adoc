Title: Java EE Sample Application

Each Java EE sample application comes with JUnit unit tests that can be run in Eclipse, IntelliJ, NetBeans, Maven, Ant or any IDE or build system without special plugins using Apache TomEE as an embedded JavaEE container.
The easiest way to run a Java EE sample application in your IDE is to use maven (_mvn eclipse:eclipse_ or _mvn idea:idea_) to generate project descriptors.
