Installation of Bouncy Castle for use in TomEE itself is done in two steps:

. Add the Bouncy Castle provider jar to the `$JAVA_HOME/jre/lib/ext` directory
. Create a Bouncy Castle provider entry in the  `$JAVA_HOME/jre/lib/security/java.security` file

The entry to `java.security` will look something like the following:

[source,properties]
----
security.provider.N=org.bouncycastle.jce.provider.BouncyCastleProvider
----

Replace `N` with the order of precedence you would like to give Bouncy Castle in comparison to the other providers in the file.

* *Recommended* would be the last entry in the list -- `N` being the higest number in the list.
* *Warning:* configuring Bouncy Castle as the first provider, `security.provider.1`, may cause JVM errors.
