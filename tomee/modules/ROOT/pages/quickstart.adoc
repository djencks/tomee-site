= Installation

To install OpenEJB, simply xref:downloads.adoc[download the latest binary]  and unpack your zip or tar.gz into the directory where you want OpenEJB to live.

Windows users can download the zip and unpack it with the WinZip program.

Linux users can download the tar.gz and unpack it with the following command:

_tar xzvf openejb-3.0.tar.gz_

Congratulations, you've installed OpenEJB.

If you've unpacked OpenEJB into the directory C:\openejb-3.0, for example, then this directory is your OPENEJB_HOME directory.
The OPENEJB_HOME directory is referred to in various parts of the documentation, so it's good to remember where it is.

= Using OpenEJB

Now all you need to do is move to the bin directory in OPENEJB_HOME, the directory where OpenEJB was unpacked, and type:

_openejb_

For Windows users, that looks like this:

_C:\openejb-3.0> bin\openejb_

For UNIX/Linux/Mac OS X users, that looks like this:

`xref:user@host-openejb-3.0.adoc[user@host openejb-3.0]

= ./bin/openejb`

You really only need to know two commands to use OpenEJB, xref:openejbx30:deploy-tool.adoc[deploy]  and [start|OPENEJBx30:Startup] . Both are completely documented and have examples.

For help information and command options, try this:

____
openejb deploy --help openejb start --help
____

For examples on using the start command and options, try this:

____
openejb start --examples
____

That's it!

If you don't have any EJBs or clients to run, try the ubiquitous xref:openejbx30:hello-world.adoc[Hello World]  example.
