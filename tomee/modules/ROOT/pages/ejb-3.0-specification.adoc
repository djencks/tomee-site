Title: EJB 3.0 Specification +++<a name="EJB3.0Specification-Specification">++++++</a>+++

= Specification

The EJB 3.0 specification can be downloaded from the http://www.jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=220[JSR 220]  at the JCP (Java Community Process) website after clicking through the JCP's online agreement.
The specification is very large, but there's a download named _'ejb-3_0-fr-spec-simplified.pdf'_ that is very short and highly recommended as an introduction to EJB 3.0.
