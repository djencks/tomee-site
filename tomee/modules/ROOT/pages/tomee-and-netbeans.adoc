There is some great information over at https://blogs.oracle.com/geertjan/entry/tomee_apache_cxf_and_maven[Geertjan's Blog] on how to hit the ground running with Netbeans, CXF and Maven.
Geertjan is a Netbeans evangelist and has an incredible insight into everything Netbeans.

*WORKAROUND*: There is a known issue with Netbeans 8 and TomEE detection that currently requires the following workaround:

Netbeans 8 has a bug in which it fails to find the *tomee-common-[version].jar* in the *[TomEE]/lib* directory.
The solution is to simply rename the jar file to an older version.

For example, you have *[TomEE]/lib/tomee-common-1.6.0.2.jar* or *[TomEE]/lib/tomee-common-1.7.1.jar*.
Rename these files to *[TomEE]/lib/tomee-common-1.6.0.jar*

This should resolve the detection issue and will not break your installation - Be sure to document the change for yourself as a reminder.

Here is a quick run through on how to set up TomEE. We will use one of the existing examples for this demo.
Let's import it.
